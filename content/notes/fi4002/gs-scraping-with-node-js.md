## introduction
+ Google Scholar data can be scaped without coding but use a online web scaping tool, e.g. Octoparse ([Jones, 2023](https://www.octoparse.com/blog/scrape-google-scholar)) or ParseHub ([Miranda, 2022](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/scrape-google-scholar/)).
+ Python and Beautiful Soup, one of its package for parsing HTML and XML, can be also used to scrape Google Scholar data ([iWeb Data Scraping, 2023](https://iwebdatascrapingservices.medium.com/how-to-scrape-google-scholar-data-using-python-a0d5a26b385f)), which must pay attention to IP blocks due to simple API ([Ganesan, 2020](https://proxiesapi-com.medium.com/scraping-google-scholar-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-850cbdfedbcf)).
+ There is also Python package written for Google Scholar scaping, which requires only few lines of codes ([DataKund, 2022](https://pypi.org/project/scrape-google-scholar/)).
+ PHP with the help of Simple HTML DOM Parser are able to collect data of hundreds of lectures from several faculties in a university ([Putri et al., 2021](https://conference.upnvj.ac.id/index.php/senamika/article/view/1390)).
