## 10-5 Calculating the Rotational Inertia (1 of 11)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.20 Determine the rotational inertia of a body if it is
given in Table 10-2.
+ 10.21 Calculate the rotational inertia of body by
integration over the mass elements of the body.
+ 10.22 Apply the parallel-axis theorem for a rotation axis
that is displaced from a p


## 10-6 Torque (1 of 6)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.23 Identify that a torque on a body involves a force and a
position vector, which extends from a rotation axis to
the point where the force is applied.
+ 10.24 Calculate the torque by using (a) the angle between the
position vector and the force vector, (b) the line of
action and the moment arm of the force, and (c) the
force component perpendicular to the position vector.
+ 10.25 Identify that a rotation axis must always be specified to
calculate a torque.


## 10-6 Torque (2 of 6)
+ 10.26 Identify that a torque is assigned a positive or negative
sign depending on the direction it tends to make the
body rotate about a specified rotation axis: “clocks are
negative.”
+ 10.27 When more than one torque acts on a body about a
rotation axis, calculate the net torque.


## 10-7 Newton's Second Law for Rotation (1 of 8)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.28 Apply Newton's second law for rotation to relate
the net torque on a body to the body's rotational
inertia and rotational acceleration, all calculated
relative to a specified rotation axis.


## 10-8 Work and Rotational Kinetic Energy (1 of 9)
Learning Objectives
+ 10.29 Calculate the work done by a torque acting on a rotating body by
integrating the torque with respect to the angle of rotation.
+ 10.30 Apply the work-kinetic energy theorem to relate the work done by
a torque to the resulting change in the rotational kinetic energy of
the body.
+ 10.31 Calculate the work done by a constant torque by relating the work
to the angle through which the body rotates.
+ 10.32 Calculate the power of a torque by finding the rate at which work is
done.
+ 10.33 Calculate the power of a torque at any given instant by relating it to
the torque and the angular velocity at that instant.
